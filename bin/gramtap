🚀 Telegram App Setup Guide
============================

Before using Gramtap, you need to create a Telegram app and get your API credentials.
This is a one-time setup process that takes just a few minutes.

📋 What you'll need:
   • API ID (a number like 123456)
   • API Hash (a string like 'abc123def456...')

🔍 Why do I need these?
   API ID and Hash are unique identifiers that allow your app to communicate
   with Telegram's servers. They're like a username and password for your app.
   Don't worry - they're safe to use and won't give anyone access to your account.

📝 Step-by-step instructions:

   1. 🌐 Go to https://my.telegram.org
      
   2. 🔐 Log in with your phone number (the same one you use for Telegram)
      
   3. 📱 Enter the verification code sent to your Telegram app
      
   4. 🛠️  Click "API Development Tools"
      
   5. 📋 Fill out the form to create a new app:
      • App title: "Gramtap" (or any name you prefer)
      • Short name: "gramtap" (or any short identifier)
      • URL: Leave blank (not required)
      • Platform: Choose "Desktop"
      • Description: "CLI tool for Telegram" (optional)
      
   6. 📄 Click "Create application"
      
   7. 📝 Copy your credentials:
      • API ID: The number shown (like 123456)
      • API Hash: The long string shown (like 'abc123def456...')

🔐 Keep these credentials safe:
   • Don't share them publicly
   • Store them securely (Gramtap will help you with this)
   • You can regenerate them if needed from my.telegram.org

📖 Official documentation:
   • Telegram API docs: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
   • App registration: https://my.telegram.org

✅ Next steps:
   Once you have your API ID and Hash, run 'gramtap login' to authenticate
   and start using Gramtap!
